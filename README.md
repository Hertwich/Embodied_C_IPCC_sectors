The code requires access to EXIOBASE matpack files, which contain the data for the input-output analysis. 
EXIOBASE data can be downloaded from http://www.exiobase.eu/. The Matpack version is accessible on a 
dedicated box site; however, it is currently restricted due to the content of proprietary information. 
The code also utilizes the Matlab mriotree utility developed by Daniel D. Moran at NTNU.
